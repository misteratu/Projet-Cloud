# Project Cloud: Automation of Spark Deployment with Ansible and Terraform

## Description
In this project, we will automate the deployment of a Big Data infrastructure based on Apache Spark. To achieve this, we will use Terraform to set up the infrastructure (at least three virtual machines on KVM with libvirt) on a minimum of 2 physical hosts, and Ansible for the deployment and configuration of Spark.

Additionally, we will use the WordCount application as a test to validate the proper functioning of the installation.

## Project Steps

1. **Build the Infrastructure**
   - Use Terraform to create and configure at least four virtual machines on a KVM hypervisor across two physical machines.

2. **Automate the Deployment of Spark**
   - Write Ansible playbooks to install and configure Apache Spark on the VMs.

3. **Validation of the Deployment**
   - Deploy the WordCount application to test the proper functioning of the infrastructure and Spark using Ansible.

4. **Write the Report**
   - The report should be at least 3 pages and should describe the results of the project.

5. **A Demo is Mandatory**
   - A demo of the setup and application is required.
